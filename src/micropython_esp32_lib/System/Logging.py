    Reference: <https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/_thread.html> -> <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/_thread.html#module-_thread>

    Lock objects have the following methods:

    ## `lock.acquire(waitflag=1, timeout=-1)`
    Without any optional argument, this method acquires the lock unconditionally, if necessary waiting until it is released by another thread (only one thread at a time can acquire a lock — that’s their reason for existence).

    If the integer waitflag argument is present, the action depends on its value: if it is zero, the lock is only acquired if it can be acquired immediately without waiting, while if it is nonzero, the lock is acquired unconditionally as above.

    If the floating-point timeout argument is present and positive, it specifies the maximum wait time in seconds before returning. A negative timeout argument specifies an unbounded wait. You cannot specify a timeout if waitflag is zero.

    The return value is True if the lock is acquired successfully, False if not.

    Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new.

    Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquires can now be interrupted by signals on POSIX.

    ## `lock.release()`
    Releases the lock. The lock must have been acquired earlier, but not necessarily by the same thread.

    ## `lock.locked()`
    Return the status of the lock: True if it has been acquired by some thread, False if not.
